# Smart DApps Builder

Smart DApps Builder is a comprehensive platform designed for creating, managing, and deploying decentralized applications (DApps) on the blockchain. This project provides a user-friendly interface for developers and users to interact with various DApps, leveraging the power of smart contracts and blockchain technology.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)
- Truffle (for smart contract deployment)
- Ganache (for local blockchain development)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/SmartDappsBuilder.git
cd SmartDappsBuilder
```

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your MongoDB connection string:

   ```plaintext
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/smart_dapps_builder
   PORT=5000
   ```

4. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Smart Contract Deployment

1. Navigate to the SmartContracts directory:

   ```bash
   cd SmartContracts
   ```

2. Compile the smart contracts:

   ```bash
   truffle compile
   ```

3. Deploy the smart contracts to the local blockchain:

   ```bash
   truffle migrate --network development
   ```

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the Smart DApps Builder application.
2. Register a new account or log in with an existing account.
3. Use the interface to create new DApps, view existing DApps, and interact with the AI module for idea generation.
